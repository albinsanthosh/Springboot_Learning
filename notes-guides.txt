MVC 

Controller (Logic)

Model(data)

View template(JSP, Groovy etc)

1. web.xml - dispatcher servlet (Front controller), servlet mapping, location for the spring config file.

2. spring config file.xml - component scanning, supporting functions, MVC view resolver(prefix, suffix for getting view files)

-----Adding static files-----

resources folder in WebContent
Step 1: Add the following entry to your Spring MVC configuration file: spring-mvc-demo-servlet.xml

You can place this entry anywhere in your Spring MVC config file.

<mvc:resources mapping="/resources/**" location="/resources/"></mvc:resources> 

Step 2: Now in your view pages, you can access the static files using this syntax:

<img src="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/resources/images/spring-logo.png"> 

You need to use the JSP expression ${pageContext.request.contextPath} to access the correct root directory for your web application.

Apply the same technique for reading CSS and JavaScript.

-----Generate & Deploy War file-----

1. In Eclipse, stop Tomcat

2. Right-click your project and select Export > WAR File

3. In the Destination field, enter: <any-directory>/mycoolapp.war

4. Outside of Eclipse, start Tomcat
- If you are using MS Windows, then you should find it on the Start menu

5. Make sure Tomcat is up and running by visiting: http://localhost:8080

6. Deploy your new WAR file by copying it to <tomcat-install-directory>\webapps

Give it about 10-15 seconds to make the deployment. You'll know the deployment is over because you'll see a new folder created in webapps ... with your WAR file name.

7. Visit your new app. If your war file was: mycoolapp.war then you can access it with:  http://localhost:8080/mycoolapp/
